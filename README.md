# GQR factorization
We expose the orthogonal decomposition called Generalized QR Factorization (GQR) and RQ factorization applied to LSE problem.

# LSE
The solution of equality constrained least squares problem (LSE) is given through four analytics methods:
Generalized QR Factorization.
Lagrange Multipliers.
Direct Elimination.
Nullspace method.

Also, is given a solution of the model of quaternion equality constrained least squares problem through the transformations from quaternions to real value matrices, and viceversa.
