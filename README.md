# GQR factorization
We expose the orthogonal decomposition called Generalized QR Factorization (GQR) and RQ factorization applied to LSE problem.

# LSE
The solution of equality constrained least squares problem (LSE) is given through four analytics methods:
Generalized QR Factorization.
Lagrange Multipliers.
Direct Elimination.
Nullspace method.

Also, is given a solution of the model of quaternion equality constrained least squares problem through the transformations from quaternions to real value matrices, and viceversa.

Ther code proposed in RStudio, requires package MASS and pracma.
