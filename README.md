# **GQR factorization**
We expose the orthogonal decomposition called Generalized QR Factorization (GQR) and RQ factorization applied to equality constrained least squares problem (LSE).

# **LSE**
The solution of the LSE problem is given through four analytics methods:
1. Generalized QR Factorization.
2. Lagrange Multipliers.
3. Direct Elimination.
4. Nullspace method.

Also, is given a solution of the model of quaternion equality constrained least squares problem through the transformations from quaternions to real value matrices, and viceversa.

Ther code developed in RStudio, requires package MASS and pracma.
