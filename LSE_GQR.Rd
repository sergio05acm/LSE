\title{
LSE and GQR Factorization
}
\description{
This code provides the solution of equality constrained least squares problem through Generalized QR Factorization.
}
\usage{
LSE_GQR(A,C,b,d)
}

\arguments{
  \item{A}{
  Design matrix, m rows and n columns.
  }
  \item{C}{
  Constraint matrix, p rows and n columns.
  }
  \item{b}{
  Response vector for A, Ax=b, m rows and 1 column.
  }
  \item{d}{
  Response vector for C, Cx=d, p rows and 1 column.
  }
}
\details{
This algorithm provides the solution of the equality constrained least squares problem through
Generalized QR factorization. This algorithm allows one equation of constraints for each equation in the design matrix, i.e., matrices A and C mus have the same number of rows.
}
\value{
Numerical vector for a LSE problem.
